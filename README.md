## Aim:

To design a combined UX scenario that integrates healthcare and e-commerce features into a unified, user-friendly interface, improving usability and overall experience.

## Algorithm:

Identify User Needs: Analyze user behaviors in healthcare and shopping contexts.

Design Unified UI: Develop intuitive layouts supporting both health tracking and product browsing.

Integrate Core Features: Include appointment booking, product recommendations, and secure payment gateways.

Test & Refine: Conduct usability testing and refine based on user feedback.

Deploy & Monitor: Launch the prototype and analyze real user interactions for improvement.


## Output:
### 1. Solution Ideation: Hospital Appointment Booking App

#### Method Used: Crazy 8s Ideation Exercise

Eight rapid ideas were generated to improve appointment booking efficiency:

One-tap “Book Now” button on the home screen.

Interactive calendar showing doctor availability.

Chatbot assistant guiding users through the booking process.

Filter doctors by department or specialization.

Voice search for quick, hands-free navigation.

Emergency booking shortcut for urgent cases.

Auto-filled patient details using saved profiles.

Push/SMS reminders to prevent missed appointments.

### 2. Creating User Stories

Using diverse personas (student, parent, senior citizen, freelancer), the following stories were created:

| # | User Story                                                                                     |
| - | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | As a student, I want to book a doctor quickly so that I don’t miss my class.                   |
| 2 | As a parent, I want to view nearby pediatricians so that I can choose conveniently.            |
| 3 | As a senior citizen, I want large fonts and voice assistance so that I can use the app easily. |
| 4 | As a working professional, I want appointment reminders so that I don’t miss consultations.    |
| 5 | As a new user, I want to see top-rated doctors first so that I can make an informed choice.    |

### 3. Creating Scenarios

#### Chosen User Story:

As a student, I want to book a doctor quickly, so that I don’t miss my class.

Scenario Narrative:
Deeksha, a 20-year-old college student, wakes up with a sore throat before her 10 AM class. She’s anxious but needs quick medical advice.
From her hostel room, she opens the hospital app, taps “Book Now”, filters by “General Physician,” and books a 9 AM slot instantly. A confirmation SMS reassures her, reducing stress and helping her manage her day efficiently.

Emotional State: Anxious but relieved after booking.

Environment: Hostel room, early morning.

Tasks: Open app → Choose doctor → Book appointment → Receive confirmation.
